# zigbeePHY

##Introduction

Zigbee is a low power and low rate wireless communication protocol that was designed for the applications which require a high battery lifetime together
with a relatively low data rate. Its Physical Layer (PHY) is specified in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The following project aims at proposing an architecture
of the zigbee PHY (transceiver) which is compliant with the aforementioned standard.
